# Charging-Station-Optimisation

The future of vehicle transport is electric. The Mayor of London has set policy objectives which require all newly registered vehicles in London to be zero-emission capable by 2030. This includes the iconic London Black Cab taxi fleet, totalling 21,000 vehicles. To achieve this, large scale rapid charging infrastructure must be installed to enable taxi drivers to quickly charge their vehicles during the day.

These notebooks are part of my masters thesis which takes an optimisation approach based on the fixed-charge location problem formulation to select locations for rapid chargers in the Greater London area for taxi use at various levels of service coverage. The charging demand is derived from traffic flows on major roads across the city.
